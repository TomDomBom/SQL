MYSQL:
    RANK() / DENSE_RANK
    Syntax: RANK() OVER ([PARTITION BY partition_expression, ... ]
                ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC], ...)
    RANK() - give each row a rank according to a specific ordering
    DENSE_RANK() - same thing, but will not permit gaps in ranking ex: two at 3 will not skip to 5
    WITH cte AS
    Syntax: WITH cte_name (column1, column2, ...) AS (
        SELECT ...
        FROM ...
        WHERE ...
    )
    CTEs are commonly used to simplify complex SQL queries, 
    improve query readability, 
    and break down large queries into smaller, more manageable parts.
